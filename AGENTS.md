# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds application code. Key folders: `components/` (shared UI), `components/ui/` (shadcn/ui), `features/` (feature modules), `routes/` (TanStack Router file-based routes), `hooks/`, `lib/`, and `integrations/`.
- Tests are colocated in `src/` with files named `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`.
- Static assets live in `public/`. Global styles are in `src/styles.css`.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by the router tooling. Do not edit it manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use Bun (preferred) or the equivalent npm/pnpm scripts.
- `bun run dev`: start Vite dev server on port 3000.
- `bun run build`: production build plus TypeScript typecheck.
- `bun run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `bun run test`: run Vitest in CI mode.
- `bun run lint`: run ESLint.
- `bun run format`: run Prettier.
- `bun run check`: format and auto-fix lint issues.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React with Tailwind CSS. Prefer shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui`.
- Prettier config: no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas.
- Naming: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for utilities and hooks (prefix hooks with `use`), `kebab-case` for CSS, `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Feature modules should follow `src/features/<feature>/` with `components/`, `hooks/`, `api/`, and `types.ts`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Vitest + Testing Library with `jsdom`, setup in `src/test-setup.ts`.
- Name tests `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` and colocate with the unit under test.
- Add or update tests for new UI behavior, data hooks, and edge cases.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits follow Conventional Commit prefixes like `feat:` and `chore:`. Use the same style.
- PRs should include a brief description, linked issues (if any), and screenshots for UI changes. Note how tests were run.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Keep secrets out of the repo. Use environment files for local config.
- Avoid committing generated or cache artifacts such as `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
